     4) Swap value change interchange without any temporaly variable or builtin method? if you consider any two value a=4 and b=8
       that aslike result a=8 and b=4 output.
     5) Given that rekursion that n=n+1
                                  n=n+1+n+2
                                  n=n+1+n+2+n+3 .....
                                  that 
                                  int(func1,funct2)
                                  if func2=0
                                    return 0
